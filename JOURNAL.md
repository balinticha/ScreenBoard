## 10/28/2025 1 AM - Picked out the components  

I spent quite some time looking at available components, these are my choices:

**Chip:** [The RP2040](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/RaspberryPi-RP2040/C2040), of course. It has awesome C support (which is one of my goals with this project) and a huge resource base.
**Screen**: [HS20S010B](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/HS-HS20S010B/C5329586), a comfortable 320x240 colored LCD.
**Connector:** [TYPE-C-31-M-12](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Korean_HropartsElec-TYPE_C_31_M12/C165948). Unfortunately, this is in the extended library, but for life they don't have a type C connector in basic. This is paired with a [SRV05-4-P-T7 surge protector](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/ProTekDevices-SRV05_4_PT7/C85364).
**LDO**: [AMS1117-3.3](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Advanced_MonolithicSystems-AMS1117_33/C6186). A bit concerned about the thermals, but I'll give it a wide copper pour, and it should be fine.
**Flash**: [W25Q16JVSSIQ](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/WinbondElec-W25Q16JVSSIQ/C131025), the same one used in the RPI Pico.
**Crystal:** [TAXM12M4RLBDDT2T](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Yajingxin-TAXM12M4RLBDDT2T/C133334)
**Buttons:** [TS-1088-AR02016](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/XUNPU-TS_1088AR02016/C720477)

I also spent a good hour staring at the official rp 2040 example board's PCB design.

Oh, and I pre-purchased the screen just in case, as I watched it's stock go down from 240 to 40.

## 10/28/2025 11 AM - First version of the schematic complete  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjE3NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--bda49364c648ef2992243d9fba56b7307be421bc/image.png)

It's a bit messy, but it should work. I might change the GPIO pin layouts later depending on their actual physical location on the 2040, and the files are due for a visual cleanup, but that's something to worry about later. 
  

## 10/28/2025 12 PM - Added some LED indicators

Added some basic white LED indicators, one for when the board is powered, the other two is controllable by the rp2040, as they might come in handy later.

I used [the KT-0805W](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Hubei_KENTOElec-KT0805W/C34499) leds, as they are in the basic library, and they look pretty cool:

## 10/28/2025 5 PM - Schematic improvements + ESD protection  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjIzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4d1d7e7d1ab7e8c94ffd3ea848092ee5d686ad4d/image.png)

Spent a few hours cleaning up the schematic, adding some resistors I forgot to add, making it look neater, and adding the ESD protector. I wasted most of the time trying to understand the component and trying to come up with how to route it. I'm still confused.  

## 10/28/2025 6 PM - LDO and Crystal changes  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjI1NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--62dd4d530e1dd94c5b8ed79d8d4d2039bb7e8e87/image.png)

I went over everything, double checking the schematics, reading up on the components, and I was scared away from using the AMS1117. So I swapped it out to a NCP1117 LP. Sure, it's not in the basic library, but an extra 3 loading fee is a lot cheaper than a PCB that does not turn on.

And since the original crystal I picked was already in extended, I might as well swap it out to the exact one used in the RP Pico, so we have on less points of failure.
I think it's ready for PCB routing.  

## 10/28/2025 9 PM - Made the rough PCB layout  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjMzMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3a39f50b33ef129ebcf9847e051750885a5039fd/image.png)

I made the rough PCB layout, assigned the footprints, and changed around a bunch of pins to better fit the physical layout.

Also fixed up every symbol imported from EasyEDA to have proper pin types so ERC can be ran. This took quite some time until I figured it out.

  

## 10/29/2025 1 AM - PCB Routing - Part 1  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4540da8b12ea84a0887d711c52e3e55f5967c5de/image.png)

Routed the clock, buttons, leds, connectors, the flash, and the LDO. Power delivery and the ground pour is left. And lots of double checking and optimizations.
  

## 10/29/2025 2 AM - PCB Routing - Part 2  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b3b860fa3966231cd5832f5efbdf7575cc1f8fe0/image.png)

Completed power delivery and grounding. Still have 38 DRC errors to fix, but it is coming together nicely. I also had to modify the schematic slightly to add some extra resistors for the screen SPIO pins due to their long length
